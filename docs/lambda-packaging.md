To include **both your TypeScript compiled code and the necessary library dependencies** inside the `lambda.zip` deployment package for AWS Lambda, you need to package your project code **along with the `node_modules` folder** containing the installed dependencies. Hereâ€™s how to do it properly:

### Step-by-step process to include dependencies in `lambda.zip`

1. **Compile your TypeScript code** into JavaScript (e.g., into `dist/`):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This produces your compiled Lambda handler and related files in `dist/`.

2. **Install production dependencies inside the output directory** (or copy them there):

    - One common approach is to run `npm install --production` in the folder where your compiled code resides, so only runtime dependencies are included:
      ```bash
      cd dist
      npm install --production
      ```
    - Alternatively, you can copy your `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to `dist/` and run the above command there.

3. **Package the contents of the `dist/` folder including `node_modules`** into a zip file:

    - Make sure you zip the **contents** of `dist/`, not the folder itself:
      ```bash
      cd dist
      zip -r ../lambda.zip .
      ```
   This zip now contains:
    - Your compiled JavaScript files (e.g., `index.js`)
    - The `node_modules` folder with all necessary libraries

4. **Upload the `lambda.zip`** file to AWS Lambda via AWS Console, CLI, or infrastructure-as-code tools.

### Why this works

- AWS Lambda expects your deployment package to contain your code **and** all dependencies your code requires in `node_modules`, because the Lambda runtime does not install dependencies for you.
- By installing dependencies inside your deployment folder (`dist/`), you ensure the Lambda environment finds all required libraries at runtime.
- Zipping only the contents of the folder (not the folder itself) ensures the Lambda handler file is at the root level of the zip, which Lambda requires.

| Compile TypeScript               | `npm run build` (outputs to `dist/`)                                                             |
| Copy `package.json` to `dist/`  | `cp package.json dist/` and `cp package-lock.json dist/` (optional but recommended)               |
| Install production dependencies  | `cd dist && npm install --production`                                                            |
| Zip deployment package           | `cd dist && zip -r ../lambda.zip .`                                                              |
| Upload to Lambda                 | Via AWS Console or CLI: `aws lambda update-function-code --function-name YourFunction --zip-file fileb://lambda.zip` |

### Alternative: Use Lambda Layers for Dependencies

If your dependencies are large or shared across multiple Lambdas, consider packaging dependencies into a **Lambda Layer** and attaching it to your function. This keeps your deployment package smaller and allows sharing dependencies.

### Summary

To include dependencies in your Lambda deployment package:

- Compile your TypeScript to JavaScript.
- Install production dependencies inside the compiled output folder.
- Zip the contents of that folder including `node_modules`.
- Upload the zip to AWS Lambda.

This approach ensures your Lambda function has all code and libraries it needs to run successfully[1][2][3].
